# Predicting COVID-19 Hospitalizations in EU Countries
The COVID-19 pandemic is not news to anyone at this point, and for the past year and then some, front-line workers have been working as best as they can to treat patients who have fallen ill due to the virus as well as to prevent further spread of the virus. One of the biggest problems early on in the pandemic was a shortage of hospital beds and supplies for the sick, so, in order to prevent that from happening again, it would be useful for hospital workers to know how many patients to expect in the next week so that they might be able to prepare accordingly.
